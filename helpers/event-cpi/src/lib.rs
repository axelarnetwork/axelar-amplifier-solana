/// Prior to Anchor v0.31, discriminators were always 8 bytes in size. However, starting with Anchor
/// v0.31, it is possible to override the default discriminators, and discriminator length is no
/// longer fixed, which means this trait can also be implemented for non-Anchor programs.
///
/// It's important that the discriminator is always unique for the type you're implementing it
/// for. While the discriminator can be at any length (including zero), the IDL generation does not
/// currently allow empty discriminators for safety and convenience reasons. However, the trait
/// definition still allows empty discriminators because some non-Anchor programs, e.g. the SPL
/// Token program, don't have account discriminators. In that case, safety checks should never
/// depend on the discriminator.
